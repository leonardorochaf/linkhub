# Development Reflection

## AI Tools Usage

I used AI tools primarily for boilerplate code generation and documentation. The main use cases were:

- Initial project structure setup
- Documentation templates

## Manual Development Decisions

The core architecture and key features were developed manually:

- Database schema design in Supabase
- Authentication flow and security implementation
- State management approach
- API endpoint organization

## Critical Thinking & Decision Making

Several important decisions required careful consideration:

1. **Authentication Strategy**: Choosing between JWT and session-based auth, considering security implications and user experience
2. **Data Structure**: Designing the link management system to be both flexible and performant
3. **Privacy Controls**: Implementing granular privacy settings while maintaining a simple user interface
4. **Performance Optimization**: Deciding which features to implement client-side vs. server-side

## Future Improvements

Given more time, I would focus on:

1. **Analytics**: Adding basic analytics to help users understand their profile performance
2. **Customization**: Implementing more theme options and layout variations
3. **Testing**: Expanding test coverage for critical user flows
